/// # CGGeometry Operators
///
/// This file provides mathematical operators for Core Graphics geometry types.
/// It extends `CGPoint`, `CGSize`, `CGRect`, and `CGVector` with arithmetic operations
/// including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with scalars and vectors.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The operators allow for intuitive mathematical operations on geometry types:
///
/// ```swift
/// let point = CGPoint(x: 10, y: 20)
/// let scaledPoint = point * 2.0  // CGPoint(x: 20, y: 40)
/// let translatedPoint = point + CGPoint(x: 5, y: 5)  // CGPoint(x: 15, y: 25)
/// ```
