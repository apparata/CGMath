/// # CGVector Convenience Extensions
///
/// This module provides convenient extensions for `CGVector` that add useful initializers,
/// mathematical operations, and utility functions for working with vectors in 2D space.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The extensions include:
/// - Alternative initializers for creating vectors from sizes or with uniform values
/// - Vector normalization for unit vectors
/// - Vector mathematics including dot and cross products
/// - Distance calculations between vectors
/// - Averaging functions for collections of vectors
/// - Methods for creating new vectors with modified components
